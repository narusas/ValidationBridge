# JSR 303 Bean Validator to jQuery Validation Bridge
## Why I make this library
I work with spring, JPA, Bean Validation and jquery. 

I wrote validation rule twice every time. Java(Bean Validation) and Javascript(jQuery Validation)

I hate this. If I change validation rule, write twice. Sometimes I forgot modify another site, Application go wrong.

So I make this library.
